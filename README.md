# Cześć! 👋

**I'm Jakub** - 16 years old, born and living in Poland, High school student, interested in **iOS** and **Full-stack** development.

I first started with programming in October 2020 (I was 13 at the time), when the coronavirus pandemic led to closing all schools in Poland, forcing students and teachers to continue learning online. Back in October 2020, my brother asked me if I would like to try getting into the programming world, and recommended me a code learning app - [mimo](https://mimo.org/).

At first I was very excited to learn Web Development, especially considering the very little effort I had to put in (mimo is a mobile app like duolingo, so I was laying on my bed and easily learning the basics). Then I began with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I was still a kid, hence I lost my motivation quickly after getting into these two. Been going on and off for several months, but in 2023 I started taking coding seriously. In may I began **learning iOS development**.

> _Fun fact: in september 2022, I got accepted to a IT technician class in a technical school. Because I didn't care about hardware, and I was more interested in software development, just 2 months later I switched to homeschooling to study it on my own._
